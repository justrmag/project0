Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My first website is about my interest in game design and shows a brief preview/snapshots of what I have designed and gives a short insight on fundementals in game design and game engines used.All the requirements from the brief have been implemented in the code in various files.

Below shows a list of the html files included in project0.

index.html: This is the main/start file with the start webpage. It gives an brief introduction to the webpage and contains an image of a game controller in it. It also gives two links to list.html and image.html files. Lastly it contains a styles.css file link.

image.html- It contains a bootstrap link to implement one of its components, the contextual .badge-* class on an <a> element. The file also includes a mobile-responsive @media query. Plus it includes a image with 50% width.

list.html: It includes the same styles.css file link as the one in index.html. This file shows the implementation of unordered lists in html together with html links to other webpages.

videogame.html: It contains a bootstrap link with a "Submit" button together with a form tab which contains a radio type of input plus a datalist of type ID with questions related to game design to the user.

column.html: It contains the bootstrap's grid model which implements 3 columns for layout purposes as discussed in the brief.

table.html: This file shows html's table layout and gives out info of my top 3 personal game engines to use when one decides to design video games.

maintainence.html: It contains two CSS files which have been traspilled from two SCSS files (newstyles.css and maintainence.css). This file also shows an alert-danger in the div tag which is a CSS component.

styles.css: A CSS file with more than 5 different properties including border, colour, font size to name a few. With different selectors such as body, p and li to name a few.

maintainence.scss:contains one SCSS variable, an example of SCSS nesting and inheritance.

newstyles.scss:contains one SCSS variable, an example of SCSS nesting and inheritance.
